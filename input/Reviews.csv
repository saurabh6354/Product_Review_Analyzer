“Refreshing” from OG Blackwidow Chroma",08/08/2023,"New purchase since having the original Blackwidow Chroma for six or seven years.  I got that keyboard on sale and it came with a set of metal WASD keycaps.  After years of use, the matte coating was wearing off and I needed an extra keyboard at work.  Seeing the Halo v3 on sale, I went and bought it to use at home.  I forgot how audible the “click” is on fresh green switches.  The old keyboard has since “lost” that distinct click and now sounds closer to the yellow switches.  I’m okay with losing the macro keys and pass through since I never bothered anyway.  The new media button and bar seem like a good QoL addition.  The font on the keys have been updated and are a lot easier to read.  The wrist rest, if it could be called that, is absolute trash - I’m not even bothering with taking it out of the plastic wrap.  The original was always a dust magnet -especially in the spaces under the keys due to how the design “closed” them in.  The new form factor seems like it’ll be a lot easier to clean with canned air.  I already had Synapse so the keyboard was plug-and-play with Chroma settings enabled.  Overall, it matches the original’s value.  It would be a true upgrade and must-buy if they included a half-decent wrist rest.  Also, points off for Amazon slapping the shipping label on the retail box and calling it a day.  Could have easily been stolen either in transit or after delivery.  Why even tempt thieves like this???"

Good board",19/10/2023,"The switches are very loud, do not underestimate the clickyness of these keys. Is a great keyboard though, works great, and the RGB lighting is very bright and interactive in game  with the included razer software."

Great Upgrade",10/10/2023,"I am an author, not a gamer, but I love this ergonomic keyboard for my long stretches in front of the computer! The mechanical typing sounds are so soothing and give lil bits of endorphins and the LED options are so fun!"

good keyboard",15/10/2023,"my only complaint is that hand-rest is not attached to the keyboard in any way. Also, I don't know if it's me, but I can't figure out any crazy rgp setups like I used to on SteelSeries.Otherwise, great keyboard."

Decent Keyboard",28/02/2023,"Overall, I love typing and playing games on this keyboard, it gets the job done! If you’re a casual gamer this will be good enough and is satisfying to type and do homework with. Only thing you will notice is the back space feels cheap and is by far the loudest key for some weird reason.For enthusiasts, the space bar isn’t the greatest, it’s just average. A little rattle, but had a nice, firm press that you can actually feel when actuate. Bunny hopping in FPS games is no problem. With the RGB, it’s fairly weak, and you expect more for paying for something over $100. The razor software is on the lower tier of RGB software and is he brightness is dim compared to even $50 keyboards. Not a big issue for me, so I won’t knock it too much. The silent keys aren’t silent, but they give off enough sound to feel satisfying and the feedback is OUTSTANDING! When you press a key, you can feel the switch, it’s hard to explain but it gives enough feedback so you know when the key is pressed it feels “heavy” then light again after actuation. After little time it becomes subconscious feedback that you don’t realize you’re using, it’s great, by far the best keyboard I had for gaming and schoolwork. I’m a coder so it’s nice having the not so noises keys and satisfying feel. It’s really hard to explain in a description, but if you’re worried on how the yellow switches feel, don’t be. Other than that everything else is solid, nothing fantastic. Keyboard has some bend, volume controls wheel is nice (kind of don’t like the location tho would still prefer the function key) and the software is good enough for shortcuts. I also like how you can disable the windows key while gaming, little nice feature. Arm rest is okay, I have an L shaped desk so the middle kinda floats and I still don’t have slipping issues like others were saying. It doesn’t help that much, it’s just nicer to feel than the desk and having your wrists elevated is more important imo. Overall very solid, would give 5 stars if it went above and beyond. However, the keys are above and beyond and that’s what matters most"

This is the best keyboard I have owned.",10/06/2023,I could wish for a brighter display but that wish pales in comparison to what this does for my typing experience. Mine has what are called green switches. They click before the key closes and character goes up on the screen. My last nice new keyboard would not let me rest my fingers lightly on the keyboard. Barely touching any key on that last keyboard would be the same as pushing it all the way down.This keyboard has something else that is really really helpful. The F and J keys have a bumps on them so when you reach down to start typing you do not have to look to see where your fingers might happen to be. This little helpful thing is absent on almost all other keyboards.I do not game. I do a lot of typing and having a key not be pressed until it clicks is very nice. I can rest my fingers on the keyboard between key pushes. Nothing bad happens.The software that basically controls the lighting effects is pretty cluncky and somewhat difficult to use. This is not nearly as important as the feel of the keyboard as I type right now.I highly recommend this keyboard with green switches to anyone who spends time on their computer typing. I write C++ source code and it is so nice to be able to think about the code and not about my fingers. I am 80 years old and multitasking is not that easy for me now.

Wake me when you need me.",28/06/2023,"Already owned the Razer Black Widow v3 TKL (wireless) but wanted the Halo Edition to match my Razer Halo Goliathus mousepad cause: aesthetics. Being that I've been using a TKL for years, it surprised me how much bigger the Halo BW v3 is, especially with the wrist rest. Speaking of, it's not quite the most comfortable wrist rest, and though it's claimed to be magnetic, that's not my experience at all. The keys are also very loud and clicky. Almost too much. Had to readjust my noise gate on my mic lol. I do love the cable routing options, although it'd be nice if you could unplug the USB cable on both ends. My biggest complaint has nothing to do with the keyboard however, but with the way amazon shipped it. Instead of shipping it in a brown, discreet box, they just slapped a shipping label on the retail box and called it a day. A risky decision to say the least. Surprised it wasn't stolen in transit."

Razer BlackWidow V3 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard",08/09/2023,4 stars because it has been really inconvenient that the wrist rest doesn't attach. It doesn't have any grip on it so it slides all over the place and drives me crazy sometimes. The keyboard itself is nice though!
