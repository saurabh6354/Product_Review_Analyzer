Another great smart home purchase, to say the least.",14/08/2023,"My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 – aside from familiarity with the brand – was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room – the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say – though I may be wrong about this – that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only – at this point anyway – required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter – I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal – also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important – add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections – they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome ""drop-in"" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!"

A Versatile Smart Speaker for Everyday Use",18/10/2023,"I've been using the Echo Dot (5th Gen) for a few months now, and I've been really impressed with it. It's a small, unassuming device, but it's packed with features. AND A WAY BETTER MIC then gen 4One of the things I love most about the Echo Dot is how versatile it is. I use it for everything from playing music to controlling my smart home to setting alarms. It's also great for answering my questions and providing me with information.The Echo Dot's sound quality is also surprisingly good. It's not going to replace a high-end speaker system, but it's definitely good enough for everyday listening. I especially like using it to play music in the kitchen or bedroom. and I can not stress how convenient is to not have to raise my voice even when the speaker is playing music, I did have to raise my voice on earlier modelsOverall, I'm really happy with the Echo Dot (5th Gen). It's a great value for the price, and it's made my life a lot easier.Here are some specific examples of how I use the Echo Dot in my everyday life:I use it to wake me up in the morning with a gradual alarm.( Mic still pics me up without having to yell at max volume)I use it to set timers when I'm cooking.I use it to play music while I'm getting ready for work or cleaning the house.I use it to control my smart home devices, such as my lights, thermostat, and security system.I use it to ask questions and get information, such as the weather forecast, news headlines, and sports scores.I use it to play games and listen to audiobooks.If you're looking for a smart speaker that is easy to use and affordable, the Echo Dot (5th Gen) is a great option. It's a versatile device that can be used for a variety of tasks, and it makes everyday life a little bit easier."

They do everything they say they will do and probably a lot more - A few annoyances",24/10/2023,"Just put 3 of these in a 3 level home along with all the various other bulbs and devices. They are insanely easy to set up and they find new devices very well.I have two main issues with them:Even though they are on separate floors sometimes the wrong one will respond even though I'm standing in the same room with one. For example, I'm in the family room and ask it something and I can hear the one in the basement respond.  Or I am standing in the family room next to a new smart light bulb and ask Alexa to find the new device, the one in the family will respond and speak but the bulb will get ""connected"" to the echo in the basement.  All three of them have been given different ""Names""... Alexa, Ziggy, and whatever I named the one on the second floor. Interestingly the one on the second floor never seems to get confused and respond when it shouldn't, the issue seems confined to the family room and basement devices. Internet says to turn down the volume on the one that shouldn't respond. So I did that, to almost 0% but it doesn't' seem to matter. Internet says to turn off communications on the one that shouldn't answer, did that and it still responds.  Internet says move them further apart or don't put them in rooms ""on top"" of each other. Will try that.Second issue are the constant notifications and various noises. I just figured out how to turn them off within the Alexa app on the phone and there were an incredible number of separate notifications to turn off."

This is a great start to a smart home",17/10/2023,"I was really excited when I got this to start the home automation process for our house. We have a loft area apt and have now 3 alexa devices. Besides from being a bit laggy at some points where Alexa just takes more than a minute to execute a command that I have set this works as expected. However there is one flaw that is very annoying.Because we are in a lofted space our bedroom is very close to our living room, I have this one in the bedroom and the white one with a digital clock in the living room. When I say Alexa ""some action"" the bedroom one does listen to what I say, however it will only respond on the living room one for some reason. Not the biggest problem for us cause again, they are pretty close and the sound travels. But I would like it to ensure that it responds from the one that I was the closest to.I read posts about this and it is an on-going issue with Amazon, hence the reason for my 4 stars, however this issue did not happen always, its been working as expected ever since I got it until now for about 2-3 weeks. I searched everywhere to come up with a solution. Finally I just caved and applied the band aid fix that everyone was doing ""Switching the wake command"" So now my living room is Alex and my bedroom is Echo to wake. This was challenging to get a hang of for me but for my wife even worse lol.All in all, this is a good product with minor faults. If you are looking to start your home automation journey this would be a good start!"

Low vision user",15/10/2023,"I am using Siri to write this, so please excuse me for any strange words. This came in the mail. I didn’t open it for at least two days being worried about how complicated it was going to be the set up. Luckily Amazon sent you several emails before you get it to help you set it up and download the Alexa application And I did everything that they sent to me and then when I plugged it in I think I had to answer about two questions and I was done. I’ve never done anything so easy. No matter how analog you are if you can plug in one wire to the device and answer the questions online before you get it you’re done this Hass to be the most simple thing I’ve ever installed in my house in my lifetime. I also ordered the  Switches for the lights that I used to see a little bit around the house like doorways and things and I ordered two of those and just ordered four more those you just plug in the wall and boom you’re done again this is so easy it’s funny I worried about it and I worried about nothing. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. If you want to have a challenge, do it with your eyes closed and see if you can get it done :-)"

Did Alexa get stupider or is it just me?",14/03/2023,"The product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this.  Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it.  How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot."

""UPDATE 3"" - It has some downsides but good overall.",21/10/2022,"FINAL UPDATE!!!If you have a dot already and you're not in a rush to update you're not missing out. The sound quality is better. Like most people I connect my dot to a Bluetooth speaker. So the updated sound quality is mute.The Eero installed mesh wifi is cool if you need to kill a dead zone. Definitely worth it ONLY IF you already have and Eero or plan on getting one. Tech support isn't the best in this department. Read below. When I did get the tech support in the U.S. the knowledge of the Eero wifi was much better. The Tech Support they out source to foreign countries is terrible. They told me the Dot and the Eero don't work together because I didn't buy them together. Amazon was quick to give me a phone call after my review so know that they do read reviews and in good faith will do everything to rectify the problem (A huge plus for Amazon.)So the problem I had was not with the Echo Dot, but with the Eero wifi mesh extender.With the Eero it's all about placement when it comes to these Echo dots. You want your Echo to be in the 5ghz range and NOT the 2.5Ghz. range. Do what you can to get the hub closer. It makes a HUGE difference. I did some digging online and found out that the Eero does well and placed up high also. I purchased a 100 foot cat5 network cable ($17). I Moved the Eero hub to the center of the house. I set it on top of a cabinet. The back room, where I was pulling 5-20mps is up to 432mps download. That's without using the Eero extension on the Echo Dot.The dot has a motion sensor and tempurature sensor that works with my Smartthings Hub. I have not used them because I already have motion and temp sensors in this room that have active scenarios working.I'm going to keep this one and test the sensors a bit more and compare them to ones I have set up already.I would give this four stars but I can't overlook the comedy of foreign tech support. This would've been a frustrating experience if I was pressed to get things working.ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!This junk is going back to the pit of hell it came from. Both of them. It's a good idea but fails in its execution.The Eero built into these are random. Sometimes you connect, sometimes you don't. I could stand a foot away from it and it will not connect to the Eero.This is a BRAND NEW product. If you buy this know that you are part of the BETA TEST crowd. You are the guinea pigs that Amazon is perfecting this on. So you pay your money so they can test this out.On one of my many calls to tech support they told me they only had very little training on these.The old wifi worked better than this.IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!!!!!!!!  WAIT TILL THEY WORK THE KINKS OUT!!!!New update!!!They don’t know what the hell they are doing at tech support.Stupid stuff I was told.1. It will only work when you buy them together. (The Eero and Echo dot with Eero installed.)Firmware needs to update. “How do I do that?” I ask. “I escalated the ticket to a higher level tech support.” I hung up. Called back and got a different tech. They told me to update simply tell Alexa,”Alexa, update firmware.” Like I told the other tech, the firmware is updated. Two tech calls ago the guy did it.So now they say they gotta call me back because they need to figure it out. LOL!!!!!STOOOOPID!This gets worse and worse. So now I’m on the phone AGAIN with tech support. This idiot told me the Echo Dot with EERO won’t work with the Eero mesh I purchased because ,”I did not buy them together.” What special kind of stupid is this!! So Eero is putting their name on products that do NOT work with other EERO products. I asked to speak to someone else. I’ve been on hold for 20min.Amazon got something’s right but this is a mess.Tech support has no clue on how to fix this. I’m going to return this crap. But now I want to see how dumb tech support is.They asked which model do I have.There’s only one with EERO in it.She didn’t know that.Ten minutes later and I’m back on the phone with tech support. Signal drops constantly. Tech support no help on this one hot piece of garbage!!!!I spent some time on the phone with tech support. This had to be configured so the Eero would work. I’m getting good download speeds now. I hope it lasts. The sound is a bit of an improvement. More bass and highs. It’s not easy to set up the Eero. They had to. Get inside and configure it to work. A hassle but it works. Tech support for Amazon can’t help. Call the Eero hot line.This won’t even hold the wi-fi signal. My router is the the living-room. The download speeds standing next to the Eero mesh wifi is great. 550mps.In the office I installed the New Echo dot with eero installed for mesh. Without the Echo dot I’m getting 91mps. That’s just off the Eero transmitting from the living room. Better than I expected.Now when I hook the Echo Dot up and I run the test.I get a whopping 0.14 mbps download. I’m sitting a foot away from it.Total garbage."

Definitely a must-have!",17/10/2023,"I have personally never been a fan of Amazon products before, but after I had seen the Echo Dot on sale for Prime Day I decided to give it a shot and see how well it performed. Upon completing the setup, the voice-recognition was working perfectly and the sound quality was great. The only downside would be the range of your voice but that is because my Echo is left inside my bedroom. Connecting this with a bulb/smart plug would be a great addition as well. I have the smart plug connected to my LED's and my bulb connected to my living room light. Simply asking Alexa to turn these on when I get home makes it easier for me to bring in groceries without worrying about turning on the light manually. If you are thinking about purchasing this then definitely go for it when it goes on sale or for full price as you will not be disappointed!"

Great Sound, Still Problems",20/10/2023,"I got this on Prime Day on sale and I have to say the sound is wonderful. It's the time of year when I play Christmas music all the time and I wanted it for our bedroom, especially to play instrumental themes before bed.I am still having the same complaint with this as I do about our Echo Show 5. Sometimes you have to BELLOW at the damn thing to get it to pay attention to you. Last night I gave it a nightly routine command, ""Reading Time,"" which times 15 minutes for us to read, and instead it wanted to read a book to us. The 1st and 2nd generation Dots were a lot more sound sensitive. I never had either of them constantly comment, ""I didn't understand, can you say that again."" For God's sake, make the voice recognition more sensitive again. Even a bird chirping outside will interfere with the new Echo devices understanding you. It also responds to my husband's voice better than it does to mine. Are the new Echo units now gender-biased????"
